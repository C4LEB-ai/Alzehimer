# Deep Learning-Based Classification of Brain MRI Scans for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Age Group Detection Using the OASIS Dataset
The objective is to develop and evaluate three deep learning models (Artificial Neural Network - ANN, Convolutional Neural Network - CNN, and Recurrent Neural Network - RNN) using the OASIS dataset to accurately classify brain image scans into the appropriate classes, including young, middle-aged, nondemented older adults, and demented older adults with Alzheimer's disease. This involves preprocessing the MRI data, splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets, building the ANN, CNN, and RNN models, training them, optimizing their hyperparameters, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best-performing model will be selected for accurate classification of brain image scans in the OASIS dataset. Python packages such as TensorFlow or Keras for model development, NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for model evaluation and metrics calculation will be utilized.
